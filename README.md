The LinkedBlockingQueue and ConcurrentLinkedQueue have frequently used queues and concurrent applications in java.

# What is LinkedBlockingQueue?
. LinkedBlockingQueue is an optionally-bounded blocking queue based on linked nodes, which means its size is specified if needed.

# What is ConcurrentLinkedQueue ?
ConcurrentLinkedQueue is an unbounded thread-safe queue based on linked nodes.

. The new elements are inserted at the tail of the queue, and the queue retrieval operations obtain elements at the head of the queue.
